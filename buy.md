# Where to Buy Games for Linux
Those who are familiar with Wine and Proton will know that one doesn't necessarily need native Linux builds of games in order to play them on Linux. However, for those who still want to show their appreciation for the developers who do go out of their way to support Linux, below is a list of online stores where natively Linux-compatible games are available for purchase.

## Steam
This is perhaps the most obvious one, as Valve has made a point of providing outstanding support for Linux in recent years, although much of what makes Steam good for Linux gaming is in the way it facilitates running Windows games. With all the hype around Proton, one could almost overlook the fact that Steam also has games that run natively on Linux, which comprise over 13% of Steam's catalog as of the last update to this page.

## Itch.io
Itch.io is notable for being another store with an official desktop app for Linux. Like Steam, it can install Windows games and run them (if you have Wine installed), but if you want games specifically for Linux, it has a few tens of thousands of those too. Over 9% of the store's immense indie catalog is Linux-compatible as of the last update to this page.

## GOG
GOG, with its famously DRM-free catalog, naturally has some games for your free operating system. More than 23% of GOG's games are marked as Linux-compatible as of the last update to this page.

The optional Galaxy launcher is still Windows-only, but there are some unofficial GOG clients for Linux:

* Minigalaxy: [`https://github.com/sharkwouter/minigalaxy`](https://github.com/sharkwouter/minigalaxy)
* Heroic Games Launcher: [`https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher`](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher)
  * This one was originally an unofficial Epic Games Store launcher, but has since added support for GOG as well.
* LGOGDownloader: [`https://github.com/Sude-/lgogdownloader`](https://github.com/Sude-/lgogdownloader)
  * Command-line interface only.
* Wyvern: [`https://github.com/nicohman/wyvern`](https://github.com/nicohman/wyvern)
  * Command-line interface only, and seemingly no longer under development.

## Humble Store
Humble Bundle is known largely for selling bundles of Steam keys, but the site also has its own store, and many of its games are DRM-free and available as direct downloads. About 51% of those games are also available for Linux as of the last update to this page.

## ZOOM Platform
ZOOM Platform is a lesser known store with a modest selection of mostly old games. Like GOG's games, these are DRM-free, and some of them are available for Linux. (Many of those are just packaged with the Linux versions of DOSBox and ScummVM, but it's still nice to see.)

## Game Jolt
Game Jolt is another relatively obscure site, with plenty of free games as well as some commercial releases.
